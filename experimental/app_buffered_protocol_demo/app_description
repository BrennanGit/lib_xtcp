Example of TCP server utilising the buffered API.  It uses the fixed length buffered reading
to fetch a packet header from the port, decode the length field, and fetch the remaining
bytes from the packet.  It prints those bytes, and then sends a fixed length response.  The
'test' subdirectory contains a python script that operates the PC end of the link.
